# Timeline App

## Project Stage 1: Static HTML Skeleton

This stage of the project focuses on creating the foundational HTML structure for the Timeline Application. The `index.html` file contains all the necessary semantic tags and placeholders to build upon.

### ðŸ”§ Key Components of this Stage

- âœ… A `<header>` with a logo and a theme toggle button
- âœ… A `<nav>` element to hold future filter controls
- âœ… A `<section id="timeline">` where the timeline events will be displayed
- âœ… An empty `<div id="modal">` to be used for pop-up windows
- âœ… A `<footer>` for site-wide information

---

This basic structure sets the stage for future development such as styling, interactivity, and dynamic content rendering.
